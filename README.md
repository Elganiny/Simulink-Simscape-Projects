Welcome to the Simulink and Simscape Projects Repository!

This repository serves as a collection of projects showcasing the capabilities of Simulink and Simscape for modeling and simulating dynamic systems. From self-balancing robots to complex mechanical systems, these projects offer hands-on experience in control theory, dynamics, and simulation techniques.

Key Features:
* **Diverse Project Portfolio:** Explore a variety of projects, each demonstrating different aspects of Simulink and Simscape, from simple control systems to intricate mechanical simulations.
* **Educational Resource:** Designed as an educational resource, these projects provide practical examples for learning and experimenting with Simulink and Simscape.
* **Customizable Solutions:** Each project is structured to be modular and customizable, allowing users to adapt and extend the simulations to suit their specific requirements.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Extensive documentation accompanies each project, offering insights into simulation setups, control algorithms, and implementation details. Additionally, example scenarios and use cases are provided to aid understanding and experimentation.

## Built With

The projects in this repository are primarily built using:

* **MATLAB/Simulink:** A high-level programming language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming.
* **Simscape:** A specialized add-on to Simulink that enables modeling and simulating multidomain physical systems.

These tools provide a powerful framework for modeling and simulating dynamic systems, offering a wide range of functionalities for control systems, mechanical systems, electrical systems, and more.

Additionally, the projects may utilize other MATLAB toolboxes, libraries, or external components for specific functionalities or integrations.


## Example Project: Self-Balance Robot Simulation

As an example, this repository includes a simulation of a self-balancing robot, demonstrating the capabilities of MATLAB/Simulink and Simscape for modeling complex dynamic systems.
